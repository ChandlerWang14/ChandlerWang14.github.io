I am a first-year (starting from 2024) Ph.D. student at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Hengshuang Zhao](https://hszhao.github.io). 
Before joining HKU, I got my bachelor degree in computer science at Peking University in July 2024. 
My research interests lie in the field of deep learning and computer vision, especially for AIGC and multi-modal models. 
I enjoy exploring the world through my footsteps, my eyes, and taking photographs with my Nikon Zf ðŸ“·.
You can contact me at yiyangwang [at] connect [dot] hku [dot] hk.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
